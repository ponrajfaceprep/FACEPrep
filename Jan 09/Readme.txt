Started learning with Spring, and Spring is one of the most popular and powerful frameworks in the Java ecosystem. It helps developers build scalable and maintainable applications with ease. It simplifies common tasks like dependency injection, transaction management, and data handling, making the development process faster and more efficient.

Constructor Injection is a way to inject dependencies into a Spring bean using its constructor. This means that when Spring creates the bean, it automatically passes the required dependencies. Constructor injection is great for mandatory dependencies, which the bean can't function without.

Setter Injection is another approach where dependencies are injected using setter methods after the bean is created. This is useful when the bean has optional dependencies or you want to change the dependencies later.

Overall, Spring helps you manage your application's components in a flexible way, and constructor/setter injection are two common ways to ensure that your beans have the right dependencies at the right time.
